### Submission of Task 1 for Delta App Dev Inductions 2018

(An App for Thanos!!!)

{AppDev - Task 1:

Problem Statement
The Mighty Thanos is on his way to Xandar to retrieve the Power Gem on Sanctuary 2. But, he finds himself extremely bored during his journey on the ship with no foes to fight for now. He decides to give his army some time for a chance to entertain him before he picks off people randomly to fight with! Being Ebony Maw, the most genius intellect of The Black Order, people turn to you for help. Can you help them?

Build him an app where he can experience the joy of obtaining all the infinity stones until he reaches Xandar and starts the journey for real!

## Normal Mode
- Have a button that chooses one of the infinity stones randomly each time it is clicked and stores it in a list.
- A view must change color according to the color of particular stone.
- A text view must change text mentioning which stone Thanos has obtained, for example, “You have got the soul stone.”
- A bonus text (or anything, left upto your creativity) must be shown once all the six stones have been obtained and then the list must be reset.
- At any point, the app must show the list of stones retrieved so far.
- The list of infinity stones and it’s color:
  - Power Stone - Purple
  - Space Stone - Blue
  - Time Stone - Green
  - Reality Stone - Red
  - Soul Stone - Orange
  - Mind Stone - Yellow


## Hacker Mode
Add a reset button that gives Thanos the ability to reset the app at any point.
The app must retain the list of stones that was obtained, even after closing it and opening again.
Improve your User Interface, make it more enticing for Thanos and optimise it for landscape mode as well.
